# Highest Number Pairing Problem

This program is the Kotlin version of a [program written in Swift](https://github.com/reuschj/HighestNumberPairing). It's currently a work-in-progress, but is roughly working. To get into the same shape as it's Swift equivalent, I need to improve the handling of other results, get the command line input working and write some unit tests.

This program solves a simple math problem...

## Problem
Find two numbers that add up to the given number (by default is 8), such that the product multiplied by the difference produces the largest possible value.
